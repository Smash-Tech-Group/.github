## Hi there 👋 Welcome To Smash Technology

This is to co-ordinate stuff easily for the frontend, backend and mobile tasks, though it'll probably expand

head over to the [teams repo](https://github.com/smash-tech-group/teams) and make an issue or talk in the discussion so you can get access to your team's private repo(s)

New Members:
- Reach Out to the Team Lead or IT Support in the organization to get write access to the repo
- Don't give just anyone write access to the repos, if you mess up cos someone `git push --force`d
- No one should commit to main, you should make branches and approve PRs
